# udacity-data-analysis

Originally this course was in Python 2 with many errors and few not resolved even in the discussions. These errors were mainly in NumPy and data cleaning phase in Lecture 1. This code is in Python 3 without any warning or error. Few other solutions are also added which were not discussed in the lecture videos.

L1_Starter_Code.ipynb is for 1st lesson ie. Data Analysis Process. L2_Starter_Code.ipynb is for 2nd lesson ie. NumPy and Pandas for 1D Data. L3_Starter_Code.ipynb is for 3rd lesson ie. NumPy and Pandas for 2D Data.
