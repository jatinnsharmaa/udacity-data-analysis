# udacity-data-analysis

Originally this course was in Python 2 with many errors and few not resolved even in the discussions. These errors are mainly in NumPy and data cleaning phase in Lecture 1. This code is in Python 3 without any warning or error. Few other solutions are also added which were not discussed in the lecture videos.
